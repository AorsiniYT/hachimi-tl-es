# Install / Use
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Uninstall any current translation patches you still have.
> For the old UmaTL patch, run update.bat first to get the latest uninstall improvements, followed by uninstall.bat

1. Download and install [Hachimi].
1. Download [our config](../../releases/tag/config) and put it in the hachimi folder (details in link).
1. Run the game and download the update.
    - If no update is offered, open the Hachimi menu (default: `right arrow` key) and re-run the `first time setup`.

# Updating
Hachimi will automatically check for updates when you start the game. If an update is available, you'll be asked if you want to download it and it will be applied immediately, no restart required.

# Translation sources
Translations are sourced from various members & projects of the fan community, including UmaTL itself.
Check [in-depth credits on the wiki](../../wiki/Translation-Progress) and support the contributors if you can!

# Contributing translations
Use the [UmaTL] tools and contribute them there (I will take care of transferring them), or use [Carotene] or [ZokuZoku] and contribute the Hachimi format files here as a PR. Join our Discord or open an Issue for further discussion or help.

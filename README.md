    - For UmaTL, run update.bat (recent improvements for uninstalling) followed by uninstall.bat
1. Download and install [Hachimi].
1. Start the game, select a repo, then **cancel** the update Hachimi offers.
    - If this repo is listed, select it, accept the update/download, and skip the other steps.
1. Go to your game install folder (with umamusume.exe) and open the config.json file in a text editor.
1. Change the link in "**translation_repo_index**" to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UmaTL/hachimi-tl-en/release/index.json`
1. Use `right arrow` key in game to open Hachimi.
1. In the Hachimi menu, press `Reload config` followed by `Check updates` and download the update.

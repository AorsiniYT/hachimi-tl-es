# Install / Use
If you're already using Hachimi, do only step 4, then let Hachimi update when you play the game.

1. Uninstall any current patches.
    - For UmaTL, run update.bat first to get the latest uninstall improvements, followed by uninstall.bat
1. Download and install [Hachimi].
1. Start the game, **cancel** Hachimi's first-time setup by closing the popup.
    <!-- - If this UmaTL repo is listed, select it, accept the update/download, and skip the rest of the steps. -->
1. Grab our config from the [Releases](../../releases/tag/config) page and follow the steps.
1. Use `right arrow` key in game to open Hachimi.
1. In the Hachimi menu, press `Reload config` followed by `Check updates` and download the update.
    - You might need to press `Reload localized data` as well when it's done.

# Updating
Hachimi will automatically check when you open the game. If an update is available, you'll be asked if you want to download it and it will be immediately applied.
